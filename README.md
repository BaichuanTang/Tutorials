# Tutorials

This repository is a set of tutorials for Hands-On Data Science. It is used to run along with the UC San Diego course COGS108 - Data Science in Practice. 

### Approach / Background

These tutorials are designed to be a minimal introduction to what you need to know to get working with data science, and starting with projects. They cover the hands-on, coding components of the material. Conceptual and background material is covered in the [https://github.com/COGS108/Lectures](Lectures). Practice with these ideas is done through the [https://github.com/COGS108/Assignments](Assignments) as well as materials for doing [https://github.com/COGS108/Projects](Projects).

These tutorials also try to interface with the vast world of existing tutorials, materials, and documentation. They are explicitly designed to give a quick introduction to a topic of interest, and then link out to more comprehensive resources.

### Requirements

The code and materials in this repository are created with [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) and require the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Any other dependencies, for specific Tutorials, are specifically addressed in the notebooks. 

### Development

This repository is under active development, and is developed and maintained by [TomDonoghue](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/).

If you have suggestions for new links or materials, and/or fixes for any issues you spot, you are welcome and invited to open Issues, and/or submit a Pull Request.
